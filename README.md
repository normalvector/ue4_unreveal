# UE4 Unreveal

A project combining the [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) into the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), as documented in this [tutorial](http://normalvector.com/tutorials/unreveal/).

**Note:** This project uses the [BLUI](https://github.com/AaronShea/BLUI) UE4 plugin which is not included in this repository and must be installed separately.
